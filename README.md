# Arbitrum-Cost-Analysis

In the following github repository you can find my report for the seminar Cryptography and Data Security
under the path './report/report.pdf'.  
Furthermore, you can find the code that was used to analyse the cost of transactions on the Arbitrum network 
in the form of a jupyter notebook under './Arbitrum_avg_cost.ipynb'.
The jupyter notebook was created with Python 3.7. However, it should also work with other python versions.  

The task was to write a 10 page report on a given topic. I completed this task but a large portion of the
time went into creating the jupyter notebook and learning how to extract data from html pages.
I hope that the jupyter notebook will be taken into considerations while grading.  

You can also find the powerpoint presentation which was given under './Marius-Asadauskas-Seminar-Cryptography-Presentation.pdf'
